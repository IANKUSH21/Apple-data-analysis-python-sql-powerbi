## üìä PROJECT INSIGHTS

### üß™ PYTHON ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS

* Cleaned and explored multi-year product sales data
* Calculated Year-over-Year (YoY) growth percentages
* Visualized gross margin trends, category-wise average sales
* Conducted correlation analysis and built a linear regression model to predict 2024 sales
* Generated pie, bar, and line charts to reveal category and regional trends

### üß† KEY FINDINGS

* **iPhone** consistently leads in sales across all years
* **Americas** region is the top-performing market in 2024
* **Services** segment shows continuous growth in net sales and margins
* High correlation across 2022‚Äì2024 net sales trends
* Products like Mac and iPad saw volatility in YoY performance

---

## üßÆ SQL INSIGHTS

* Queried top-performing products and regions
* Ranked categories using `RANK()` and `ROW_NUMBER()` functions
* Analyzed gross margin percentages per product
* Used conditional logic to classify product sales into High/Medium/Low
* Performed sales trend comparison and regional performance analysis

### üìå SAMPLE QUERIES

```sql
-- Year-over-Year Growth
SELECT
  Category,
  ROUND((2024_Net_Sales - 2023_Net_Sales)*100/2023_Net_Sales, 2) AS Growth_2024_vs_2023
FROM Net_Sales_By_Product_And_Service;

-- Top 3 Products by 2023 Sales
SELECT Category, 2023_Net_Sales
FROM Net_Sales_By_Product_And_Service
ORDER BY 2023_Net_Sales DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
